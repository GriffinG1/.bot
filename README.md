# Kurisu
A Discord server bot by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax. Designed heavily around the [Nintendo Homebrew Discord](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh).

Although it is open source, this bot is not really designed to be used in other setups at the moment; the source is mainly just available for those interested in how it works on the Nintendo Homebrew server.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.5 or above
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Be sure to use the latest version for best results.
